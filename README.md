####Spring Boot Security Example

This project is a demonstration of how to implement authentication and authorization using Spring Boot, Spring Security, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The application includes user registration and authentication endpoints, leveraging Spring Boot's robust security features.

##Features

    User Registration: Allows new users to register by providing their details.
    User Authentication: Users can authenticate using their email and password to receive a JWT token.
    JWT Integration: Secure endpoints using JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.
    Spring Security: Configured to handle security concerns, including password encoding and user role management.
    
##Technologies Used

    Spring Boot: To create a stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based application.
    Spring Security: For securing the application.
    JWT: For token-based authentication.
    H2 Database: An in-memory database for development and testing.
    Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code.
